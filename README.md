# README for "The Luxury Closet" Conversion Optimization Project

## Project Overview

**The Luxury Closet** is an online boutique based in Dubai, specializing in luxury fashion items such as handbags, clothes, watches, and jewelry. Our goal is to become the largest online marketplace in the Middle East for both new and pre-loved luxury items. This project aims to improve the conversion rate of users from active users to purchasers by addressing specific issues and implementing targeted solutions on our platform.

## Key Issues and Solutions

### 1. High Drop-offs from MPP to SPP
**Issue:** The highest number of user drop-offs occur during the transition from the Multiple Product Page (MPP) to the Single Product Page (SPP).

**Solution:**
- **Simplified Navigation:** Reduce the number of choices on the women's dropdown menu to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Trust Widgets:** Incorporate customer testimonials and experiences prominently on the homepage to build trust.

### 2. Lack of Engagement
**Issue:** Users spend an average of 1 minute and 30 seconds on the website, indicating a need for more engaging content.

**Solution:**
- **Interactive Elements:** Introduce interactive elements, videos, and dynamic content to make the pages more engaging.

### 3. Trust Factor
**Issue:** Absence of testimonial and trust-building elements can make new users hesitant.

**Solution:**
- **Customer Testimonials:** Add a dedicated section on the homepage showcasing customer testimonials and experiences.

### 4. Overwhelming Choices
**Issue:** Too many options can paralyze the user’s decision-making process.

**Solution:**
- **Hick’s Law:** Apply Hick’s Law by reducing the number of options in the initial dropdown menus to simplify user choices.

### 5. Emphasis on Discounts
**Issue:** Users may not clearly see how much they are saving on discounted items.

**Solution:**
- **Savings Display:** Clearly display the percentage saved and include a countdown timer for offers to create a sense of urgency and scarcity.
